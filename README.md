# Python Projects: Contact Book & Expense Tracker

This repository contains two Python projects I developed during my internship at **Cantilever**. These projects are designed to demonstrate my ability to build practical applications using Python, and they focus on managing contacts and tracking expenses.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Contact Book
The **Contact Book** is a simple console-based application that allows users to store, update, delete, and search for contacts. Each contact has attributes like name, phone number, email, and address. The program provides an easy interface for managing a collection of contacts.

#### Features:
- Add, update, and delete contacts.
- Search contacts by name, phone number, or email.
- Store and retrieve contact details such as phone number, email, and address.
- Simple, user-friendly interface with input validation.

### 2. Expense Tracker
The **Expense Tracker** allows users to track their daily expenses by categorizing them (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment). The application stores expense data and provides summary reports such as total spending and category-wise breakdowns. It helps users monitor their spending and budget more effectively.

#### Features:
- Add expenses with categories (e.g., food, bills, entertainment).
- View total spending and expense breakdown by category.
- Generate daily/weekly/monthly summaries.
- Track and manage your financial habits in a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **SQLite** (for storing contact and expense data locally)
- **Basic File Handling** (for saving data persistently in a simple format)
- **Text-based User Interface** (for easy interaction)

## Purpose
These projects were built as part of my **Python internship at Cantilever** to:
- Develop real-world applications using Python.
- Learn how to build simple, functional apps with user input and basic data persistence.
- Gain experience working on software solutions for organizing personal data (contacts) and finances (expenses).

## Structure of the Repository
- **contact_book.py**: Script for the Contact Book application, allowing CRUD operations on contacts.
- **expense_tracker.py**: Script for the Expense Tracker application, providing functionality to add and categorize expenses, and view reports.
- **data/**: Folder for storing database or data files (e.g., `contacts.db`, `expenses.db`).
- **README.md**: This file.
